if __name__ == '__main__':  # reason behind writing this to control the execution of code within a script or module
    # It allows us to determine whether the Python script is being run as the main program or if it is being imported
    # as a module into another script.By using this construct, you can specify which parts of your script should run
    # when it is the main program and which parts should only run when it's imported as a module.
    # The code block indented under if __name__ == '__main__': will only execute when the script is
    # run as the main program.
    print("Hello World!!")  # to print something in the cursur or in CLI
